* How can I trace the route to a server over the internet using a terminal command? Pick a website in a far-off country and try it. Use [this site](https://iplocation.com/) to find the locations of the IP addresses on the way to your destination!
* What is a URL? Which part of a URL is the scheme (protocol)? Where is the host? The port? The path? Query string? Fragment? What is the purpose of each of these parts? Which parts are required, and which are optional?

* What is a HTTP status code? What do the codes 200, 404, 500, 503, 302, 422 and 418 mean?
* Why do we use HTTP verbs? What is the difference between what GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests do?
* Use the Google Chrome inspector (or similar tools in other browsers) to find the headers for an HTTP request. What do you think these headers do?
* What is a web server? What is Rack? What is the difference between Rack and a web server? What is the difference between Rack and Sinatra?
